# 4-iOS-apps
iOS apps written in Swift for our class NPI (Nuevos Paradigmas de Interacci√≥n)

They are very simple apps that make use of some of the sensors included in our iPhones: microphone, camera, GPS, accelerometer, the touch screen, the compass...
We also made a watchOS companion app for PuntoMovimientoSonido.

All the UI is in Spanish.

There is a tutorial pdf for each project (also in Spanish) where we explain step by step how to use these sensors in iOS.
